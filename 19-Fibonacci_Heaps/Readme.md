The Fibonacci heap data structure serves a dual purpose. First, it supports a set of
operations that constitutes what is known as a “mergeable heap.” Second, several
Fibonacci-heap operations run in constant amortized time, which makes this data
structure well suited for applications that invoke these operations frequently.
