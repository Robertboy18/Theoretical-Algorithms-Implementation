Section 25.1 presents a dynamic-programming algorithm based on matrix multiplication to solve the all-pairs shortest-paths problem. Using the technique of "repeated squaring," we can achieve a running time of $\Theta\left(V^3 \lg V\right)$. Section 25.2 gives another dynamic-programming algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which runs in time $\Theta\left(V^3\right)$. Section 25.2 also covers the problem of finding the transitive closure of a directed graph, which is related to the all-pairs shortest-paths problem. Finally, Section 25.3 presents Johnson's algorithm, which solves the allpairs shortest-paths problem in $O\left(V^2 \lg V+V E\right)$ time and is a good choice for large, sparse graphs.

Before proceeding, we need to establish some conventions for adjacency-matrix representations. First, we shall generally assume that the input graph $G=(V, E)$ has $n$ vertices, so that $n=|V|$. Second, we shall use the convention of denoting matrices by uppercase letters, such as $W, L$, or $D$, and their individual elements by subscripted lowercase letters, such as $w_{i j}, l_{i j}$, or $d_{i j}$. Some matrices will have parenthesized superscripts, as in $L^{(m)}=\left(l_{i j}^{(m)}\right)$ or $D^{(m)}=\left(d_{i j}^{(m)}\right)$, to indicate iterates. Finally, for a given $n \times n$ matrix $A$, we shall assume that the value of $n$ is stored in the attribute $A$.rows.
