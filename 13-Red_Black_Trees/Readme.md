Chapter 12 showed that a binary search tree of height $h$ can support any of the basic dynamic-set operations-such as SEArCH, PredECESSOR, SuCCESSOR, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, INSERT, and DELETE-in $O(h)$ time. Thus, the set operations are fast if the height of the search tree is small. If its height is large, however, the set operations may run no faster than with a linked list. Red-black trees are one of many search-tree schemes that are "balanced" in order to guarantee that basic dynamic-set operations take $O(\lg n)$ time in the worst case.
