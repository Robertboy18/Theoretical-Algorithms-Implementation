When we look at input sizes large enough to make only the order of growth of
the running time relevant, we are studying the asymptotic efficiency of algorithms.
That is, we are concerned with how the running time of an algorithm increases with
the size of the input in the limit, as the size of the input increases without bound.
Usually, an algorithm that is asymptotically more efficient will be the best choice
for all but very small inputs.
