Many problems take the form of maximizing or minimizing an objective, given
limited resources and competing constraints. If we can specify the objective as
a linear function of certain variables, and if we can specify the constraints on
resources as equalities or inequalities on those variables, then we have a linear programming problem. Linear programs arise in a variety of practical applications.
