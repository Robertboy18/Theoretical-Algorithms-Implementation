In this chapter, we examine the representation of dynamic sets by simple data structures that use pointers. Although we can construct many complex data structures
using pointers, we present only the rudimentary ones: stacks, queues, linked lists,
and rooted trees. We also show ways to synthesize objects and pointers from arrays.
